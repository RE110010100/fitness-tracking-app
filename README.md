**--Architecture**
The architecture of this fitness application is based on a client-server model, where the front-end server is hosted on Flask, a Python web framework. The back-end server is hosted on AWS, and the communication between the front-end and back-end servers is done using REST API services. 
The data generated by users is stored in Amazon DynamoDB, a NoSQL database that offers high performance, scalability, and availability. The media files, such as user profile pictures and exercise videos, are stored in Amazon S3, a highly scalable and durable object storage service. API Gateway is used to receive requests from the client and forward them to the back-end server. It also receives the response from the back-end server and sends it back to the client. This architecture provides a highly scalable, reliable, and secure solution for the fitness application.
